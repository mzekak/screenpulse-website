                <div id="ibadah-lock" class="legal-section app-specific">
                    <h3>Ibadah Lock — Additional Terms</h3>
                    <p><strong>Purpose and Limitations:</strong> Ibadah Lock is a productivity and habit-forming tool. It is not a religious authority and its prayer time calculations are based on standard astronomical formulas. We do not guarantee the absolute accuracy of prayer times for all locations. Users should verify prayer times with their local mosque or a trusted authority for matters of religious obligation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Device Functionality:</strong> Ibadah Lock uses device-level app restriction features. By using the app, you acknowledge that you are voluntarily restricting your own device. Screen Pulse is not responsible for any consequences arising from restricted access to apps during the lock period, including missed communications or time-sensitive events. Emergency calls and contacts remain accessible at all times regardless of lock status.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Account:</strong> Since no account is created, you are solely responsible for any data stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the app will delete all local data permanently.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- APP-SPECIFIC: RU'YA -->
                <div id="ruya" class="legal-section app-specific">
                    <h3>Ru'ya — Additional Terms</h3>
                    <p><strong>Nature of Interpretations:</strong> Ru'ya provides AI-generated dream interpretations informed by Islamic scholarly tradition. These interpretations are for personal reflection and spiritual guidance only. They do not constitute religious rulings (fatwa), psychological advice, medical advice, or predictions of any kind. We strongly encourage users to consult qualified scholars and professionals for formal religious or medical guidance.</p>
                    <p><strong>User Content:</strong> Dream entries you submit remain your personal property. By submitting content, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to process and store it solely for the purpose of providing the service to you. We do not use your dream content for any other purpose.</p>
                    <p><strong>Account Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:support@screenpulse.shop">support@screenpulse.shop</a> if you suspect unauthorized use of your account.</p>
                    <p><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You may delete your account at any time from within the app or at <a href="https://www.screenpulse.shop/ruya-delete-account.html">screenpulse.shop/ruya-delete-account.html</a>. Deletion is permanent and irreversible. All your data will be permanently removed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Subscription:</strong> Ru'ya offers a free tier with limited interpretations and a paid subscription for unlimited access. Free tier limits may change over time. Subscribers receive uninterrupted unlimited access for the duration of their subscription period.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- APP-SPECIFIC: DROP THE RECEIPTS -->
                <div id="drop-the-receipts" class="legal-section app-specific">
                    <h3>Drop the Receipts — Additional Terms</h3>
                    <p><strong>Nature of Verdicts:</strong> Drop the Receipts provides AI-generated verdicts for entertainment and personal reflection purposes only. Verdicts are not legal advice, relationship counseling, psychological guidance, or binding decisions of any kind. The AI may be inaccurate, one-sided, or lack full context. Do not make important life decisions based solely on a verdict generated by this app.</p>
                    <p><strong>Content You Submit:</strong> By submitting text or screenshots for a verdict, you confirm that you have the right to share that content and that doing so does not violate any third party's privacy, confidentiality, or legal rights. You must not submit content that includes private information about individuals who have not consented to having their communications shared with an AI service.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prohibited Content:</strong> You may not submit content that is illegal, defamatory, harassing, abusive, or that includes the personal information of minors. We reserve the right to refuse service to any user who submits prohibited content.</p>
                    <p><strong>No Storage of Submissions:</strong> We do not retain your submitted content after a verdict is generated. However, you are solely responsible for how you use and share verdict cards generated from your submissions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shareable Verdict Cards:</strong> Verdict cards are generated for personal sharing and entertainment. You may share verdict cards freely. If a verdict card contains content derived from third parties (e.g., a screenshot of someone else's messages), you are responsible for ensuring you have the right to share that derived content.</p>
                    <p><strong>Free Uses and Subscription:</strong> Drop the Receipts provides a limited number of free verdicts. Additional verdicts require a subscription. Subscription access is personal and non-transferable.</p>
